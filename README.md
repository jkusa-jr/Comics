# Comics
A site that shows the most recent comic of your choice. If you have not entered in a comic, it defalts to garfield. To add a comic, put "/?comic=" after the link and then on the gocomics website, find the comic you like (for example Calvin and Hobbes "https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/"), and copy the part of the link after "https://www.gocomics.com/" (which would be "calvinandhobbes") and put it after "/?comic=".
